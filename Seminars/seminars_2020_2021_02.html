          <td colspan="3", style="font-size:80%">Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials are promising for future spintronic applications owing their advantageous properties such as robustness against perturbations due to magnetic fields, absence of parastatic stray fields or ultrafast dynamics (up to THz ranges). In a wide variety of AFM materials, transition metal oxides (e.g. NiO or CoO) play an important role due to their unique properties. These properties are especially evident in systems of reduced dimensionality, as pointed out by a number of studies. However, in thin film growth, as necessary for devices, the quality is often disappointing, dictated by the defect density. Here we demonstrate a route for preparing high quality ultrathin antiferromagnetic oxide films on a metallic substrate. Mixed nickel, iron and cobalt oxides have been grown on Ru(0001) by high temperature oxygen-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The nucleation and growth process are observed in real time by means of Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM), which enables to optimize of the growth parameters. A comprehensive characterization is performed combining LEEM and LEED for structural characterization and PEEM (PhotoEmission Electron Microscopy) with synchrotron radiation for chemical and magnetic analysis via X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and X-ray Magnetic Linear Dichroism (XAS-PEEM and XMLD-PEEM, respectively). Depending on the chosen stoichiometry and conditions, the growth leads to the formation of high quality 2D islands of different compositions. The high crystalline and morphological quality of prepared films result in optimized properties with respect to films grown by other methods, such as magnetic domains, larger by several orders of magnitude or Ńeel temperature, which can be adjusted at will.</td>

          <td colspan="3", style="font-size:80%">In January 1987 Philip W Anderson (December 13, 1923 – March 29, 2020)  published one of the most controversial and influential papers in the history of superconductivity[1].  Now cited over 6000 times, the paper introduced the Resonating Valence Bond theory, or RVB, of superconductivity as an explanation of the then very recently discovered 30K superconductivity in the doped quantum, antiferromagnet La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_4.  The core idea is that the strong antiferromagnetic exchange interaction combined with doping leads to a novel two-dimensional quantum spin liquid of the Cu  spins,  in which neighbouring spins form a liquid of fluctuating singlet pairs. Doped holes move through this novel quantum spin liquid as charged bosonic 'holons' which condense into a superfluid explaining high Tc superconductivity. While several aspects of the original idea have been now proved incorrect, the ideas in the theory were highly influential in developing new models of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems which do not involve electron-phonon interactions.  In this talk I shall review the ideas in the RVB and its successors and try to show which aspects of the original idea remain valid and useful after over 30 years of research into cuprate high Tc superconductivity.

          <td colspan="3", style="font-size:80%">Due to the growing demand for electricity, combined with increasing environmental awareness, renewable sources and alternative fuels have become increasingly popular in recent years. Renewable energy sources, although they make it possible to obtain energy in a non-polluting manner, face many limitations, especially in terms of the continuity of energy supply. The use of hydrogen as an energy source is not subject to such restrictions. We briefly present methods of generating energy from hydrogen and hydrogen production, with particular emphasis on photoelectrocatalytic decomposition of water. In the second part we focus on hematite (110) surface as a promising electrode for water-splitting process. We discuss its advantages, disadvantages and the approaches to improve its efficiency in hydrogen production.</td>

          <td colspan="3", style="font-size:80%">First, I will revisit Landau's Fermi liquid (FL) theory for normal metals, and thereby outline the properties of the non-Fermi liquid (NFL) metals (also called "strange" metals) which cannot be described within the Landau framework, due to the destruction of the Landau quasiparticles. In particular, I will focus on critical Fermi surface states, where there is a well-defined Fermi surface, but no quasiparticles, as a result of strong interactions between the Fermi surface and some emergent massless boson(s). I will deal with examples involving quantum phase transitions where finite-density fermions interact with an Ising-nematic order parameter, or U(1) gauge field(s). I will outline a framework to extract the low-energy physics of such systems in a controlled approximation, using the tool of dimensional regularization.
            <br>
          Finally, I will focus on Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models, which are toy-models of exactly soluble NFLs. I will consider a model with SYK fermions coupled to non-interacting lead fermions, which can be realized in a graphene flake connected to external leads. This system exhibits a quantum phase transition from an NFL phase to an FL one as a function of the ratio of the numbers of the two kinds of fermions. I will discuss the characteristics of the system after a sudden quench to the NFL, where a thermal state is reached rapidly via collapse-revival oscillations of the quasiparticle residue of the lead fermions. In contrast, the quench to the FL, across the NFL-FL transition, leads to multiple pre-thermal regimes and much slower thermalization.</td>
