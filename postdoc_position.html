      <p class="sub_title">  Quench Dynamics of Topological Materials: Dynamical Phase Transitions and Entanglement</p>

      <p class="content">
        A <a href="https://www.euraxess.pl/jobs/576828">postdoctoral position</a> for two years, starting from 1st April 2021 or soon after, is open within the theoretical physics department in the institute of physics in UMCS, Lublin. The proposed project will focus on the quantum dynamics of topological systems, focusing on dynamical phase transitions.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Project description: Quench dynamics offers a regime for highly non-equilibrium physics amenable to a general schema of classification and understanding. In contrast to the physics of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium, there is in general no way of bringing the phenomena of non-equilibrium situations into a coherent system. By focusing on particular types of dynamics in quantum systems progress has recently been made looking at, for example, quantum quenches for dynamical quantum phase transitions or thermalisation, and periodically driven systems. At the same time the discovery of topological phases has widened considerably the concept of equilibrium phases. In this project we propose to deepen and widen the current understanding of topological insulators out-of-equilibrium in their dynamics following a quench. The bulk-boundary correspondence relates the bulk topology of these systems to the existence of protected edge modes on their boundaries. One major focus of this project will be the role that these states play during time evolution, and how they modify the dynamics and the development of entanglement. Several different dynamical scenarios will be considered: Quenches and multiple sequential quenches, continuous and periodic driving, and dissipation. Periodic driving is known to potentially lead to new boundary modes which can further complicate the dynamics. Although quenches in one dimensional topological systems, and the role of the protected boundary modes has received some attention, very little to none has been done on 2D, 3D and higher order topological insulators. These systems, as well as topological systems including interaction effect which will allow for relaxation, will be one of the main focuses of this project.
